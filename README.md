# Calm Mind Spa Landing Page

[View Project](https://kind-shannon-95858a.netlify.app)

This is a SCSS focused project for Calm Mind Spa. This landing page was an academic project used to explore building complicated designs that caught our eye as a student. I took the link below and used it to inspire the website that I built using free content for a fake company calle dCalm Mind Spa. It was my first time using SCSS seriously and I learned so much about productive workflows and organization strategies. Although this website isn't fully funtional, I was proud to put my SCSS skills to the test and try and build complicated layouts from a png file.

The URL I used to inspire the layout of this website is:
